# ARIMA Holt-Winters Near Future Climate Change Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting daily average temperatures using ARIMA and Holt-Winters models, leveraging historical data from 1980 to 2010. The predictions span from 2010 to 2020, extending to 2030, providing valuable insights into near-future climate trends and potential anomalies.

## Features
- **Time Series Analysis**: Explore historical temperature data to detect seasonal patterns and long-term trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use ARIMA and Holt-Winters methods for accurate temperature forecasting.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate decomposition plots, moving averages, and confidence intervals to assess trends and variability.
- **Ethical Insights**: Discuss implications for climate policy and public health through an ethical lens.
